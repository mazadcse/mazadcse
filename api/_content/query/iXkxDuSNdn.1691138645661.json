Everything sent between anyone from one point to the other can be seen passing through the pipe. A person standing in the middle can see the things passing through the transparent pipe. This is how plain HTTP requests work. There is no layer of security to hide the contents of requests and responses. Data can be tampered with or snooped on by any party on the network like Internet Service Providers (ISPs), malicious hackers or even employers.
