To fetch these files, the client needs to know which computer (server) on the Internet they are being hosted on and open a secure connection to that computer. On a network, computers and different network devices can't identify and locate one another using names. Instead, they communicate with each other using what is known as IP addresses. Therefore, the client needs to know what the IP address of the server is. Since users can't memorize the IP address of each website they're using, the client needs a way of figuring out what IP address is associated with the given URL. This system of mapping or translating domain names to corresponding IP addresses is known as the "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Domain Name System"}]},{"type":"text","value":" or "},{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"DNS"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Domain Name System is a distributed database of hostname to IP address mappings.

Typing the IP address in the URL bar and submitting would still take you to the site, but doing that for every website you are using is not very convenient. Instead, your computer relies on DNS servers to automatically do the mapping for you. To make requests even faster, it uses caching to store mappings for easier future reference."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The role of DNS is more predominant in distributed computing for the reason that it maps domain names to the IP address of the server that is closest to the client requesting it.
