To fetch these files, the client needs to know which computer (server) on the Internet they are being hosted on and open a secure connection to that computer. On a network, computers and different network devices can't identify and locate one another using names. Instead, they communicate with each other using what is known as IP addresses. Therefore, the client needs to know what the IP address of the server is. Since users can't memorize the IP address of each website they're using, the client needs a way of figuring out what IP address is associated with the given URL.
